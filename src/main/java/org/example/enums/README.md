## Enums

An enum is a special "class" that represents a group of constants (unchangeable variables, like final variables).

To create an enum, use the enum keyword (instead of class or interface), and separate the constants with a comma.

Note that they should be in uppercase letters.

### When to use Enums:

You should use enum types any time you need to represent a fixed set of constants.
That includes natural enum types such as the planets in our solar system and data sets where you know all possible
values at compile timeâ€”for example, the choices on a menu, command line flags, and so on.
