What is Keith Number?
A positive n digit number X is called a Keith number if it is arranged in a special number sequence generated using its digits. The special sequence has first n terms as digits of x and other terms are recursively evaluated as the sum of previous n terms. For example, 197, 19, 742, 1537, etc.
